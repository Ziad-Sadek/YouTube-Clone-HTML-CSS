Description:

This project is a responsive clone of the YouTube interface, designed to showcase my proficiency in HTML and CSS. It features a clean, modern layout that mimics key components of YouTube's user interface, including:

Header Section 🖥️: A fixed navigation bar with a logo, search bar, icons for notifications 🔔, and user profile image 👤.
Video Thumbnails 📹: Displayed in a grid layout with three thumbnails per row, each with its own title 📜, creator name ✨, and image.
Sidebar Navigation 📂: Includes icons for different sections (e.g., Home 🏠, Shorts 🎬, Subscriptions ❤️) that change the background color on hover for better interactivity.
Responsive Design 📱: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure a seamless experience across devices, from desktop 💻 to mobile 📲.
This project demonstrates my ability to build visually appealing, user-friendly layouts using modern web technologies and responsive design principles.
